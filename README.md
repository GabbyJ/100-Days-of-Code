# 100-Days-of-Code
<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
<p>I am working to become a full stack web developer. I do not yet know exactly what "stack" to focus on. My goal is to be proficient enough in coding to get a Front End Developer job by the end of the year. From there I will continue working towards the Full Stack Developer goal.</p>
<p>I started this goal around August of last year and was doing very well for a few months. Through Christmas, January, and February, I haven't been doing much. And by much I mean nothing towards my goals. I was working on a WordPress site that I used as my excuse to avoid learning/ working on other things.</p>
<p>I'm hoping this 100 Days Challenge will give me a solid goal to reach which will motivate me to continue going. Whether each day brings a big achievement or a small one, at least I will be actively doing something to reach my end goal.</p>
<p>I suffer from a VERY short attention span and I get restless quickly, so committing to long periods of concentration are quite difficult for me. I will attempt the Pomodoro technique and see how I like it.<br>

<p>To hold myself accountable, I will tell specific family and friends who I know will be on my butt about finishing if I tell them to help me. I will also post my progress to Github, a couple Facebook groups, and maybe do the Twitter thing.</p>
