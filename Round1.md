<h2>Quarter 1: April 1 - April 25</h2>
<h3>Week 1: April 1- April 9</h3>
<p><strong>Day 1: April 1. Monday</strong></p>
<p>Today was my new day 1 because my original day 1 on March 1st only lasted about 2 days. So, take 2!</p>
<p>I worked on FreeCodeCamp's Introduction to Javascript section and got through 12 new sections. After a long hiatus, I restarted the Introduction to Javascript section because I felt I forgot some stuff. So including the ones I redid, I completed 17 total sections</p><p>The new sections focused on operations such as strict equality and inequality and I was introduced to functions and booleans</p>
<p><strong>Day 2: April 2. Tuesday</strong></p>
<p>I successfully completed 15 sections today in Introduction to Javascript. It focused on greater than, less than, equal to operators, else if statements, and switch statements. I feel like I have a good grasp on these sections so far.</p>
