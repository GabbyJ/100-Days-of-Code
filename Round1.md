<h2>Quarter 1: April 1 - April 25</h2>
<h3>Week 1: April 1- April 9</h3>
<p><strong>Day 1: April 1. Monday</strong></p>
<p>Today was my new day 1 because my original day 1 on March 1st only lasted about 2 days. So, take 2!<img src="https://github.com/GabbyJ/100-Days-of-Code/blob/master/Clapboard.png" width="15px" height="15px" style="text-align: center" alt=""/></p>
<p>I worked on FreeCodeCamp's Introduction to Javascript section and got through 12 new sections. After a long hiatus, I restarted the Introduction to Javascript section because I felt I forgot some stuff. So including the ones I redid, I completed 17 total sections</p><p>The new sections focused on operations such as strict equality and inequality and I was introduced to functions and booleans</p>

<p><strong>Day 2: April 2. Tuesday</strong></p>
<p>I successfully completed 15 sections today in Introduction to Javascript. It focused on greater than, less than, equal to operators, else if statements, and switch statements. I feel like I have a good grasp on these sections so far.</p>

<p><strong>Day 3: April 3. Wednesday</strong></p>
<p>Today I did 3 sections in Introduction to Javascript. Doesn't sound or look like much, but there was a Counting Cards project that I was determined to get on my own without watching a tutorial of it... I 90% did it. I'm proud I made it as far as I did on my own and I'll just make it a goal next mini project to finish without any tutorial. But that is why I only did 3 sections today. Tomorrow gets into Objects, so excited to start that and see what it brings!</p><p>PS: I subconsciously convinced a coworker to start 100 Days as well and he starts next week working on Python. We will help keep each other motivated and accountable.<img src="https://github.com/GabbyJ/100-Days-of-Code/blob/master/muscleEmoji.png" width="15px" height="15px" style="text-align: center" alt=""/> #TeamworkMakesTheDreamWork</p>

<p><strong>Day 4: April 4. Thursday</strong></p>
<p>Sadly, I didn't get a chance to do anything today. But this is not the beginning of the end for failing 100 days AGAIN.</p>
<p><strong>Day 5: April 5. Friday</strong></p>
<p>Today I completed 12 lessons in Introduction to Javascript about Objects. How to create, update, add, delete, and use it for lookups. It also talked about dot vs. bracket notation and when to use them. I feel like I'm getting it all pretty well, but tomorrow I will do a mini project to wrap up Objects and make sure I'm actually understanding/remembering what I'm learning, then the next section is While and For loops.</p>
